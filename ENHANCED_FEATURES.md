### ðŸŽ¯ **Dual Recognition Modes**
The recognition page now offers two distinct modes:

#### 1. **Live Camera Recognition**
- **Real-time face detection** from webcam
- **Live confidence display** with person names and percentages (0-100%)
- **Visual status indicators** showing camera state
- **Enhanced UI** with better controls and feedback

#### 2. **Image Upload Recognition** 
- **Static image analysis** by uploading files
- **Image preview** before recognition
- **Detailed results** with confidence bars
- **Support for multiple image formats** (JPG, PNG, etc.)

### ðŸ”§ **Technical Improvements**

#### Live Recognition Enhancements:
- Uses **face distance comparison** for faster, more reliable recognition
- **Real-time confidence calculation** (0-100%)
- **Proper error handling** and status updates
- **Optimized performance** for live video streams

#### File Recognition Improvements:
- **Hybrid approach**: SVM model with face distance fallback
- **Fixed confidence calculation** to show proper percentages
- **Better error recovery** when models fail
